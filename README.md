# TPTP-Editor
TPTP Editor is an Eclipse plugin developed on top of Xtext that enables basic IDE features TPTP files.

The ML2 Editor can be installed in any recent Eclipse release by copying this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claudenirmf/TPTP-Editor/release-branch/it.unibz.inf.tptp.parent/it.unibz.inf.tptp.repository/manually-generated-repository) into the field "Work with" at "Help > Install New Software...".

OBS: we have observed long periods for "dependencies calculations" once the installation of the plugin is requested. We apologize as we were not able to improve this issue at this point.

This project is initially build with the TPTP grammar available at [marklemay/tptpParser](https://github.com/marklemay/tptpParser/tree/master/com.theoremsandstuff.tptp.parser).
